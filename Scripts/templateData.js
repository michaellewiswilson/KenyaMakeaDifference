                I've been thinking about how I want to write this blog for awhile now simply because it's nearly impossible describe \
                what was seen, heard, and felt during these three weeks. Before leaving, I knew my eyes would be opened, but I didn't \
                know exactly to what extent and what would cause me to basically reshape my life perspective. Here's a little of what I learned...\

            <ul style='list-style: circle; margin-left: 20px;'>\
                <li>\
                    <b>Kenyans are beautiful people.</b> We were welcomed with open arms everywhere we went. Kids would instantly become your \
                best friend within 10 seconds of meeting. To me, that love and genuineness embodies their culture.\
                </li>\
                <li>\
                <b>They take care of each other.</b> One day, 2 sisters were in front of me when we were walking back to the IV. They were \
                    sharing a pair of flip flops: one wearing the right flip flop and the other wearing the left instead of one of them being completely barefoot.\
                </li>\
                <li>\
                   <b>They have pure happiness for life.</b> Despite their circumstances of not having shoes, running water, or not knowing when \
                their next meal will come, the kids and people were positive and full of life.\
                </li>\
                <li>\
                   <b>The need is high.</b>  It was difficult to see the area were in and realize the potential for the community and knowing \
                   you can't do it all. Nakuru is only a teeny tiny portion of the world living in poverty. In my day 4 journal entry, I wrote, \
                  'You hear stories of how people drop their whole lives in an instant after taking trips like this, and now I understand how they do it.'\
                </li>\
            </ul>\
            <p>\
                Ultimately, I'd say that the greatest thing about this trip was to see the impact you can have on others & a community and to \
                realize & experience the impact others have on you. Kenya will always hold a piece of my heart. <3\

                Hmm.. how to sum up the kenyan culture in one word? Genuine. Kenyans are the most genuine and loving people I have ever met. \
                I bet EVERY person we met was so welcoming to us and so happy to meet us. and Honestly happy to meet us... not just putting \
                on an act. Their openness to show compassion is truly amazing. Kenya has a very collectivistic culture and really value \
                their group membership. Everyone looks out for, and cares for others. \
            </p>\
            <p>\
                Its very different from the American individualistic \
                culture. Kenya is also very polychronic. Us Americans found this out very quickly with our 'more strict schedules' that\
                we needed to just relax and go with the flow. 'Kenya Time' is very laid back... so laid back we may have been waiting \
                for two hours for the person we were supposed to meet with to show up... or another example... we were the only ones to \
                be sitting in church at the expected time of 8oclock and the other kenyans didn't show up until about 9:30am.\

                I went on this trip with the idea of trying to make a difference in Kenya. I had no idea, however, that Kenya would make \
                an even bigger difference in me. Everything about the country is beautiful, from the landscape, to the people; from the culture, \
                to the animals. I had never been out of the country before,\
                <img src='Content/Images/2013 photos/People/KellyH.jpg' class='img-thumbnail' style='float: left; height: 350px; margin: 10px; />\
                but immediately knew it was going to be an amazing experience when \
                on the drive from the Nairobi airport to the IV, we had to slam on the brakes in order for a herd of zebras to cross the road. \
                And that was only the first story of many to come.  We spend the entire first day spending time with the local kids, and saw \
                them every day for the rest of our stay. It was the Kenyan people who truly made the trip so life changing.\
            </p>\
            <p>\
                Learning about their \
                culture, and then having them ask us so many questions about life in America was something I will never forget. On our second \
                day, we went to a local's house to visit, but when we turned to leave they asked us to stop because they had cooked us an \
                entire meal. It was so touching to see them be so generous - when so many people in America, who have so much more, are not \
                even that generous. We especially grew close with four 14 year old boys who taught us Swahili, and on our last night at the \
                IV they came to the gate with gifts for us...turns out they had used all the money they had to go to the market and buy us \
                necklaces, so that 'we would always remember them'.\
            </p>\
            <p>\
                I already miss hearing 'how are you?' everywhere I go, and hearing the \
                madness from the local Kiptenden Elementary School everyday. It was especially touching to be able to see the kids wearing \
                the shoes and clothes we brought for them at the end of the trip. It was little moments like these that will forever stay \
                with me. Just as beautiful as the people of Kenya was the landscape. Needless to say, the three day safari we went on was \
                super cool. But we also got to stand under a running waterfall, go to Menengai Crater, see the Great Rift Valley, and even \
                just the view from our porch at the IV was stunning.Kenya has taught me so many things about life. To be appreciative of \
                what I have, to give away what I don't need, and to be a better person. I couldn't have asked for a better experience and \
                I absolutely can't wait to come back some day.\

                I left half my heart in Kenya. It is impossible for pictures to describe all we learned, felt, saw and experienced. Less \
                than one month, and it changed the way I go about my daily life and the direction I intend to take my future. What stuck \
                out most was the smiles and optimism of the Kenyan people. The sincere values and selflessness by which they live touched \
                my heart and will never leave my mind. Many have next to nothing, but this only makes them more conscious of all that they \
                do have: life, family, love. This also didn't hold them back from being some of the most generous, accepting people I have \
                ever met. Even better was that I got to experience all of this with a group of amazing people, now lifelong friends who \
                share a bond that will never be broken. I fell in love with the country, culture and its people and cannot wait to be back \
                (ideally as a physician!) someday. \

                My trip to Kenya with the team of 11 girls from UWL was one of the greatest experiences that I've had in my lifetime. \
                Building a kitchen for a primary school, bringing donations for children who live off nothing, holding hands with \
                the most genuine kids I've ever met, learning kiswalhili, making new friends ill never forget, falling in love and \
                having my heart broken by a 14 year old boy, learning the culture of a completely different world, standing underneath \
                Thomson Waterfalls, and seeing lions/giraffes/zebras/cheetahs/and a leopard on our safari at Masai Mara.....I don't \
                know how anything could get any better. I AGAIN realized how completely BLESSED I am to live the life I do. The \
                experiences I've gained from this trip have had so much of an impact on my life that it is hard for me to even put \
                into words. I guess all I can say is if you ever have an opportunity to 'Make a Difference' cease it! There is no \
                better feeling in the whole world than seeing the children you meet smile.\

            "<p>\
                As I sit here trying to type up a short summary of my three-week adventure to Kenya I have the song 'One Day' by Matisyahu on \
                repeat in the background.  This song was played numerous times on our trip.  'One day', I hope I can be as inspiring, \
                thoughtful, appreciative, and as generous as the great people of Kenya were to me, despite what challenges my life leads. \
                Those are some of the qualities the people of Kenya have shown me despite their life's challenges.  The people we interacted \
                with do not live in mansions, have materialistic items, or most necessities that are needed for a persons daily life. One \
                thing these people do have though is appreciation of life.  I knew that I was guaranteed someone would change my life's \
                perspective and put a smile on my face each and everyday of my trip.   After returning home I questioned myself, why was I \
                born with such privileges, why do I have such a remarkable life?  Taking this life-changing trip to Kenya has really made me \
                appreciate what I have, and has made me thankful for every person that has been involved in my life.  The people in Kenya, \
                who have significantly less than us, get by with positive attitudes and smiles on their faces. Although I could keep going \
                on for paragraphs as to how amazing and life-changing this trip was I'm going to keep it short and list of my 'Top Ten Memorable \
                Moments' of my trip to give everyone an idea how we impacted the community.\
            </p>\
            <ul>\
               <li>Making relationships with students, teachers, parents of the people of Kenya who I can now truly say will forever be my friends.</li>\
               <li>Using the earths resources to Mud a classroom. And let me tell you, I have never been so dirty in my life! It probably took each of us 2 days to get all of the mud off of us! </li>\
               <li>Everyone in Kenya is.. well a little insane! But in a good way, starting with the driving, all the way to their sense of humor and interesting cooking ways.</li>\
               <li>To them, everything to Americans is 'dangerous' they are so protective of us and want us to have the most fulfilling and amazing experience as possible.</li>\
               <li>There are some common phrases every Kenyan child knows to say when they see a 'Mzungu' or white person. Those phrases consist of  'HI, how are you?' 'I am Fine' and 'Give me sweet'.</li>\
               <li>Although Kenyan's can walk around without shoes, wear coats and pants in 90 degree weather, eat just about anything and everything, and grab scolding hot pans, don't you dare try to tickle them because they will jump over a fence and run as fast as a cheetah screaming like a girl to get away from the scary Americans.</li>\
               <li>One memory I will NEVER forget, would be giving one of my favorite little girls Naiomi a new pair of shoes.  Hers had no sole and holes throughout the top.  That memory will never be taken away.</li>\
               <li>If you thought kids we're exhausting in America, try being attacked by twenty Kenyan children! Some of whom have never seen a white person before. They will try to rub your skin, and pick away your funny looking 'dots' (moles).  What an amazing/interesting experience it was interacting with all of the children to whom you have just met, and will remember for a lifetime.</li>\
               <li>Touring the Masai Culture and learning about all of their traditions and what a day in the life of a truly native tribe in Africa is like. It would blow your mind!</li>\
               <li>Finally, Paved roads are a luxury.  If you have ever in your life said you get 'car sick' well think again! Try riding in a Matatu or an 70's hippie van if that helps with reference, on pot holed, uneven roads for SEVEN HOURS. I now have great appreciation for cement.</li>\
            </ul>\
            <p>\
               As cliche as this sounds, a little goes a long way.  I know I have made a difference in a handful of peoples lives halfway across the world, \
               and I can say with certainty they have had a huge impact on my outlook on life. And although this trip is only  a 'little' road bump in my \
               life, it has made a huge impact in my heart that will last forever.\

            "<p>\
                It's hard to believe that less than 2 weeks ago, I was over 8000 miles away from home on the most incredible journey of my life.  \
                Just two days after arriving back in the states, I was thrown back into the lion's pit of second semester, and even though I \
                should be focusing on school, my Kenya experience has been on my mind way more than anything else!  When people ask how much \
                trip was, I usually start by saying 'where do I begin?!' because that really is the question I have yet to answer.  Everything \
                about my experience in Kenya was absolutely incredible.  My expectations of this three week adventure... far surpassed.  One of \
                the other questions that usually gets brought up right away is whether or not I saw any sweet animals.  The answer, of course, \
                is yes, but to be honest, I would have been perfectly happy had we not even gone on our 3-day safari venture before we left.  \
                It was undeniably fun, but I'd say most of my highlights came from before then, when we were able to use our talents to serve \
                the amazing people of Kenya.  Little did I know, but they were serving me too, in ways I would have never imagined.  \
            </p>\
            <p>\
                It seems crazy to say that I came back a different person, but reflecting on it, I really did.  Hope and healing are two words that \
                were very evident in many of the Kenyan's lives.  Hope for a brighter future... healing of a broken country.  But still, all \
                of the people I was fortunate enough to meet in Kenya shared another similar mindset: they were so grateful for what the Lord \
                had blessed them with.  They were well aware of their many struggles, but still they showed such gratefulness towards the \
                Lord for their families, companions, homes, farms, and just about anything else they had.  Seeing these people happy with \
                such little made me realize what a glutinous society we live in.   I know very well that I am guilty of accumulating endless\
                unnecessary 'things.'  The Kenyans are living proof that it is definitely possible to find happiness in other places besides \
                wealth.  It seems like such an obvious concept, but it has never been presented so clearly to me before as it was in Kenya.  \
                Returning from this journey, I definitely have a much greater appreciation for all the privileges I have been presented with \
                in my life.  There are the big things like school and work, that we here are blessed to have unlimited options... options that \
                many of the Kenyan's would die for.  Then there are the little things like a toothbrush or pair of shoes... things most of us \
                have never had to worry about not having... these too, are luxuries for many of the people in rural Kenya.  If I learned anything \
                on this trip, it's that I really have nothing to complain about.  A majority of the people I met would die for my worst day to be \
                there very best day.\
            </p>\
            <p>\
                Another thing that really impacted me was the fact that even when the people had nothing left to offer, they still found a way to give \
                back.  We had various community members helping us build the classroom at SOAR Kenya... because they knew what a great impact \
                the classroom would have on their youth.  They're always looking out for one another.  I felt a sense of genuineness that is \
                often hard to find in our self-consumed society.  A group of women were determined to show their appreciation for us at our \
                going away party, so even though this money would have been much better spent on food or clothing, they went out and bought \
                each of us a set of earrings and a necklace.  It was extremely difficult saying goodbye to all the friends I made in Kenya.  \
                The relationships formed and lessons I learned will surely stick with me for life.  I would go back to Kenya in a heartbeat \
                if I could!  I pray that someday I will make it back to the beautiful country.  As for now, I'll consume my days with \
                remembering the Kenyan's contagious smiles and sincere gratitude they showed us each and every day.\

                I really enjoyed doing all of the stuff we did! I loved going to the orphanage with the kids, and I loved going to the \
                classroom and mudding! On the first day of the classroom, Sheila and I may have been involved in a mud fight with all \
                the little kids who were there. Needless to say, we were highly outnumbered, and although we were by a supply of mud, \
                we seemed to run out, and the kids who were 'attacking' us never seemed to run out although we could never find where \
                they were getting the mud from! Seeing the kids smiles and hearing their laughs during the mud fight was priceless. \
                I think one of the mom's finally told the kids to stop because we were doing so poorly against them! It was so much fun \
                though! Not one person from our trip escaped that day mud free! \

            "<p>\
                My emotions are very strong right now after coming home from the trip. Before we left for the trip, I knew that it \
                would be an experience unlike anything I have experienced before and that it would be eye opening and amazing. \
                However, it turned out way better than I ever pictured. I could not have picked a better trip to participate in.  \
                Before going on the trip, I had pictures in my mind of what Kenya may be like of course.  Many of the things \
                that I pictured were true, but many were different.  For example, the community that we stayed in at the IV was \
                very like I pictured it (maybe a bit more rocky though!) but the cities (especially Nakuru and Nairobi) were \
                very different and much more westernized than I expected.  One of the more interesting things to me was the \
                very very extremes that we got to experience of Kenya. We saw the best of the best (Nairobi) and the very very \
                poor (Maasai and ourskirts of town).  It is very hard to generalize just 'Africa' or even just 'Kenya' when \
                there are such extremes...I suppose the same holds true for 'America'.  One other main realization that I had \
                was even though the people in Barut were so poor and did not have many things at all, almost everyone we met \
                seemed more than content and very happy in general.  As long as they had their health and family, they were \
                happy with life.  They know that they are poor and probably sometimes wish for more things or money, but overall \
                they are happy. It made me realize that in America we get so caught up in money and material things.  We grow \
                up with the message that money and things make us happy and the more you have, the better quality of life you have.\
            </p>\
            <p>\
                I could go on and on for hours about what I learned, what I saw, who I met, but I will try to keep this short enough for you \
                to read without falling asleep. Overall, I want to say that the experience in Kenya is something better than I could \
                ever have imagined. I thank God every day for guiding me towards this trip and I constantly find myself day dreaming \
                about being back in Kenya.  I never would have thought that I could make such close friendships or feel so at home \
                so quickly, but it happened. I will tell you the truth, when I walked into my front door here in La Crosse for the \
                first time after getting back on Saturday night, I cried.  It didn't feel like home to me anymore and all I wanted \
                more than anything was to get on the first plane back to Kenya. It is difficult for me to find workds to discribe \
                all of my feeling right now but I hope that I gave you a good taste. \

                I'll be honest, I really thought it would be easy to type up a short reflection of my trip to Kenya. I experienced so \
                much in those three weeks I could write a novel, but when I started typing this, I realized that is exactly the problem.  \
                How can I try to immerse you in an entirely different culture in just a few short paragraphs? It's like trying to take \
                one picture out of the thousands taken to show you what we did the entire trip; it's simply not possible. So instead of \
                giving you a play-by-play, I'll attempt to touch on the post-trip highlights (in a non-Troy Aiken sort of way!) so you \
                can hopefully begin to understand how this trip affected me, and, to be cliche, how it really was a life-changing experience. \
            </p>\
            <p>\
                I've been to two other developing countries in the past three years: Albania and Guatemala. One of the best (and worst) \
                parts of this trip was to compare Kenya to these other two countries; there are so many similarities yet so many \
                significant differences in how these people live their lives. It amazes me that countries who seem to be the most culturally \
                and geographically awe-inspiring also struggle so much in other ways, which is one of the reasons I wanted to go on this \
                trip. Although the trips to Menengai Crater, Thomson Falls, and the Masai Mara were once in a lifetime experiences, we all \
                knew that building the classroom at SOAR Kenya, passing out donations, and simply spending time with the Kenyan people were \
                by far the most significant parts of our trip. We were all at one time or another deeply affected by what we saw, and I \
                think what hit home more was not how most kids had no shoes or how shockingly small the houses were for the size of the \
                families living in them, but that these people were so selflessly kind and generous to us despite all of that. All the \
                kids just wanted to get a good look at us and say 'How are you??' in their high little voices. But don't be fooled, \
                they managed to destroy two soccer balls and a kickball in a matter of minutes :)\
            </p>\
            <p>\
                I am truly thankful for everybody who made this trip possible and to all the people who made us feel so welcome over there. \
                Both the volunteering and touring parts of the trip brought us all closer together as a group, and it was even harder that \
                I thought it would be to say good-bye to everyone and come back to our 'normal' lives. I can say with confidence that 17 \
                hours on a plane was worth it :) and I hope to stay very much involved with the Kenya Make a Difference project in the future.  \
                To wrap things up, I want to share part of a list I made entitled 'Things I Learned In Kenya.' I decided to start it about \
                halfway through the trip to record some of the more memorable moments we had, so here it is!\
            </p>\
            <ul>\
                <li>Kenyans are crazy. This is the first thing I learned, and learned quick. All the following statements pretty much fall under the umbrella of this one. </li>\
                <li>There is no limit to the number of people you can fit in a matatu. For clarification, a matatu is a seriously remodeled van we took most of our day trips in. If you ride in a matatu, watch your head..and your stomach. Those babies have zero shocks, and those potholes have zero roads. </li>\
                <li>People will know if you are American regardless of your skin color.  </li>\
                <li>Spicy foods are nonexistent in Kenya. This was my one big disappointment! </li>\
                <li>Potholders and fire pokers are both a lost art in Kenya. A Kenyan will grab a pot from the stove and touch burning logs bare-handed.  </li>\
                <li>It is not uncommon to see a Kenyan wearing long pants and a jacket in 85 degree weather. 60 degrees is considered cold - they would never make it through a winter in the Midwest!</li>\
                <li>Kenyans will rarely kill a bug - they will just remove it from a room and throw it outside. We did not agree with this to say the least, especially when the spider is as big as your hand. </li>\
                <li>Few Kenyans appreciate the simple joys of an ice cube. They drink everything warm. Yes Wisconsinites, even beer.</li>\
                <li>Kenyan time has a very specific meaning. This was especially funny to me as my family and I coined the term 'Guatemalan time' when we were there.</li>\
                <li>The difficulty of the Kenyan trail at Menengai Crater compared to the tourist/American trail is testament to the fact that even if you think you're in shape, those Big Macs will still weigh you down.</li>\
                <li>Prime shower time in Kenya is late afternoon. The water is doubly warm from the sun plus the water heater, and it's not cold outside once you get out. One of the things that really shocked me was how cool it got at night. Even though it was only probably in the 50s and 60s, I certainly used all my blankets and needed a sweatshirt at night and in the morning.</li>\
                <li>Kenyans don't eat just fruit for dinner, either. This was an inside joke, but on a serious note, I'm not sure if it's like this all year round, but we didn't eat anywhere near as much fresh fruit or vegetables as I thought we would.</li>\
                <li>There are a few American football fans in Kenya. We stumbled across a poor Vikings fan, who so graciously kept us updated on the Packers...</li>\
                <li>If all else fails, put some jelly on it. This was our fix for everything we ate (besides the goat roast): just topping it with peanut butter or red plum jam. We had to find a way to add some flavor!</li>\
                <li>Kenyans try to avoid doing anything touristy, especially going out to the Mara to see their own 'backyard' animals. This sort of made me sad, because the safari was incredible. Besides the giraffes, elephants, and lions (just to name a few), seeing three cheetahs attack and eat a gazelle was one of the coolest things I've ever seen!</li>\

            "<p>\
                The feeling of returning is incredibly different than the feeling of seeing Kenya for the first time.  Though much of the \
                shock factor from seeing everything for the first time is gone, there's an even larger opportunity to strengthen the \
                relationships built from the first trip.  For me, building those relationships with my friends in Kenya was wonderfully \
                fulfilling, as the people and the culture were the main reasons why I decided to take on the endeavor to lead a trip back.  \
                In the first year of going to Kenya, all I could think about for most of the trip was how astonishingly different our two \
                cultures are - upon returning all I seemed to be able to see was how wonderfully similar we are despite our differences.  \
                During this trip, I grew more as an individual than I think I ever have in three weeks' time.  It's a surreal experience \
                to see this place for the first time, but there's an indescribable feeling to be able to come back and feel like it's home.  \
                I doubt I made it even the first day in Nakuru without community members welcoming me and remembering me  from running the \
                Kiptenden Water Project about a year and a half ago - to say I was given a 'welcome back' would be a vast understatement.  \
                I was back home, and it felt incredible.\
            </p>\
            <p>\
                Over the course of the trip, I couldn't help but constantly feel excited and enthusiastic about what we were going to accomplish \
                over the three weeks.  I had all the pieces of the puzzle lying in front of me and I was chopping at the bit to put it all the \
                pieces in place.  Every day that went by was another opportunity to do something great, and I took just about every chance I took.  \
                The most emotional moment for me was seeing the classroom finished in its entirety.  For me, I've been working behind the scenes \
                on this for months - to finally see the whole masterpiece come together, it's like watching poetry in motion.  When we came to \
                the end of the trip, everybody was in tears, saddened that this unique trip of a lifetime was over.  For me, though I know I \
                may never return to the IV, I felt alive.  I knew that even though we were leaving, those relationships that I've built are \
                stronger than ever and are nowhere near ending.  I still haven't felt completely finished with Kenya, and I doubt I ever will.  \
                There's still so much work that can be done to help out this in-need community and I have no plans to stop doing all I can to help.  \
            </p>\
            <p>\
                I want to say thank you to all the people who have believed in me over this last year and thank you to all the people who supported \
                me with their donated items, donated time, or just providing spirit for the project.   I'm incredibly proud of each and every \
                member of our J-Term KMAD 2012 team and of the work we were able to accomplish.  Many famalies and hundreds of children's \
                lives will be changed for the better because of what we done.   This endeavor has been a dream of mine for a long time and \
                thank you all for helping to make this dream come true.  We truly made a difference.  \
            </p>\
